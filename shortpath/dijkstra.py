"""
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The algorithm works by iteratively picking the closest node and updating the shortest path to its neighbors.

Steps:

1 - Initialize:
    - Mark all nodes as unvisited.
    - Set the initial node's distance to 0 and all others to infinity (inf).
    - Keep track of the predecessor node for each node, which is the node that provides the shortest path.

2 - Visit the Node with the Smallest Tentative Distance:
    - For the current node, update the distances to its neighbors by comparing the existing distances to 
      the new calculated distances (current node's distance + edge weight to neighbor).

3 - Repeat:
    - Once a node is visited, it is marked as "visited" and will not be checked again.
    - Continue visiting nodes with the smallest tentative distance until all nodes are visited.

4 - End:
    - Once all nodes are visited, the shortest path from the source node to any other node is determined.
