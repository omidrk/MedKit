"""
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source node to all 
other nodes in a weighted graph. Unlike Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs 
with negative weight edges, but it is slower. It also detects if there is a negative weight 
cycle in the graph.

Steps:
1 - Initialize:
    * Set the distance of the source node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity (inf).
    * Initialize the predecessor for each node, which keeps track of the shortest path tree.

2 - Relaxation:
    * For every edge in the graph, check if the path through the edge provides a shorter 
      distance to the destination node than the current known distance. If so, update the
      distance and predecessor.

3 - Repeat:
    * Repeat the relaxation process V-1 times (where V is the number of vertices). 
      Each iteration ensures that the shortest paths for up to V-1 edges are correctly found.

4 - Negative Cycle Detection:
    * After the V-1 iterations, check all edges once more. If you can further reduce the
      distance for any node, it means that the graph contains a negative weight cycle.
